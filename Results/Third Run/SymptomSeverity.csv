Gained 25 lbs. even while going to aerobics 3 times a week, weight lifting and walking 10 miles per week. Had to stop all this exercise due to pain. Been of T 7 days and symptoms are improving. I was told by my oncologist that effexor will interfere in the effectiveness of T. T is a miracle drug for some but at some point I had to make a choice between recurrence of cancer and quality of life and I only made the decision after much prayer and careful consideration and have left the rest up to my Lord Jesus.

"Hate Tamoxifen with a passion - severe side effects - hot flashes, mood swings, weight gain, cramps, memory loss, forgetfulness, loss of motivation.  How come it prevents breast cancer when it is possible to cause three other types of cancer???? Shouldn't it prevent ALL cancers????

"Just finishing 5 miserable years on this drug, for stage 1 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, a tiny tumor.  Seems like overkill, trying to smash a fly with a sledgehammer.  I doubt I even needed to be on this horrible drug, which caused the following side effects: very stiff and painful joints - especially in the hands and feet, hot flashes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, heart irregularities (had to be put on heart med to control), tired most days, minimal hair loss.  I feel 20 years older than I am, like a shriveled up old lady. Limping around.  I get off this drug in a month and will be celebrating my 60th birthday - hoping to feel younger instead of older.   If doctors had to experience these side effects, they might prescribe this medication less often.  I don't think it was worth going through 5 years of awful quality of life to lower my chance of a recurrence by just a few percentage points.  It hardly seems worth it, and I regret doing it. It's amazing how most doctors underestimate how awful this drug can be - my gynecologist implied I was being a big baby for complaining about it.

My oncologist immediately took me off the arimidex while continuing to insist that I was not having side effects from the drug, but that I had heart disease. After a complete battery of tests my cardiologist told my oncologist that there was nothing wrong with my heart. My oncologist prescribed aromisin, which has the same and worse side effects. I have been off of arimidex for 3 weeks and finally feel like I am recovering from my chemotherapy, which actually ended in February (it is now October). I have decided to stop the drugs. I have had a negative PET scan and my blood work continues to show that I am cancer free. At age 65 I would like to live my life, and not merely exist. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it then. I am very happy with my decision but would not recommend it for everyone.

"I had a low grade carcinoma and lumpectomy with two lymph nodes removed both of which were clear as well as the surrounding tissue of the small tumor.  I have been taking the generic form of Arimidex, Anastrozole, for 20 days and have decided to discontinue the use.  I never experience side effects to medications I have taken in the past so I deliberately did not read the insert of side effects so that I wouldn't put the thought into my head that I would experience them.  In this short period of time I have suffered Waves of Nausea, Exhaustion, overall Body Pain that just cannot be alleviated with pain meds, Sleeplessness and Hot Flashes that could smelt iron ore.  I just looked at the side effects two days ago just to make sure I wasn't imagining that I could feel this miserable. The doctor wants me to take Effexor for the hot flashes but I vetoed that idea since I've not read anything positive about attempting to get off of that drug.  Taking one drug to mask the side effects of another just doesn't seem like a sound solution.  Unlike some other reviews I've read, I don't have the luxury of staying home and dealing with the side effects.  I have the responsibility of a job which I need to attend to daily and Arimidex most definitely is not conducive to this way of life.
I wish you all well if you are prescribed this medication.","in this short period of time i have suffered waves of nausea, exhaustion, overall body pain that just cannot be alleviated with pain meds, sleeplessness and hot flashes that could smelt iron ore.","Symptoms are bad: Presence of negative verb + symptoms","hot flashes",armimidex

I have pain in my right elbow, right wrist, both knees- which I had to get injections for. I am so tired all the time and my appitite comes and goes. I just wish I could be happy with this medicine, but to be honest I have stopped taking it a few times due to the pain. I even take Vicodin to help with getting aggitated from the Arimidex. That doesn't even seem to help my pain. I pray that we all get some relief soon. Good luck everyone.

"I was diagnosed in July 2010 with stage 1 lobular carcinoma.  After a lumpectomy, I had 36 treatments of radiation.

The joint pain started slowly in an elbow joint and now is in just about every joint in my body.  My fingers are stiff in the morning and swollen (I have taken my rings off).

"Diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in July 2011.  Surgery to remove mass and took out 4 lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes were negative but could not get clear tissue around the mass.  Had mastectomy in Sept. 2011.  Surgeon did not see any need for chemo or radiation. Breast tissued tested and only a 10% chance of recurring. Sent to ongologist and I'll have to say he was the most arrogant doctor ever.  He demanded I take arimidex to rid my body of the estrogren, even though I'm 67 years old and my ovaries are completely dried up, they do not even show up on a c-scan.  He also wanted me to take Fosmax to increase my bone density.  I took Armidex for one month and all the side effects listed I had them.  Dr. said I had to stay on this.  Tried for another month and the side effects got worse.  Extreme anxity and depression, joint pain so bad I couldn't walk, can't sleep, body aches and muscle pain real bad.  I have irratible bowel anyway and it has really messed me up.  My gut hurts all day no matter what I eat.  I switched to another oncologist and she says the benefit far outweighs the side effects.  Been off the meds for 6 weeks and not much improvement yet.  I will never take Foxamax after learning the high risk of its side effects and the class action law suit now is progress.  Get on the web and get all  the horrible info. about this.   Know a woman who took this and almost died from the holes it ate in her stomach and gut.  I will take my chances without the meds and try to get my life back.  I'd rather have a few years of quality life than live like this. I think drs. want to scare us into taking these meds and they're always pushing pills at us. Most days can't even get out of bed.  I was in good health until this happened.

"Dear all, I am sorry to hear/read such as bad negative statements. 

Yes the withdrawn symptoms, yes very difficult to get off the drug BUT you MUST tamper very very slowly. 
I learnt this and I am on and off this drug say once a year and/or when I want, here what I do...

From a health shop I buy some hawthorn herbs capsule (*I need the capsule to be empty*, so I put the hawthorn powder on my cereals –it is good for you, but sue that is not the topic)

Then if I started with 37.5, I open the capsule and divide the content in two>
Take for 5 days
Then>take 2 capsules 37.5 and divide the content in 3 capsule >take for 5/7days

Then you are at 37.5 (one original capsule) > take for at least 10 day (if you need to increase the dosage ...same fashion described, .. 
one 75 capsule, split in two and so on. 

AND TAKE NOTE WRITE ALL DOWN, TIME AND DOSAGE. If you use Effexor XR this way + cognitive therapy = The nightmare is over...live is fabulous again-;) (Well this is my experience anyway)

If you do not do this, yes all that bad stuff happens.
***Felling over optimist and a bit ...to happy. Write down a few notes and read them every morning, i.e. I am so confident because of the drug, don’t go overboard.

This is a great fabulous drug for anxiety/rage and depression.

PS: I have being in other antidepressants >same story.... get a pill cutter in the pharmacy.

Bottom line tampering may take you 3-4 months if you are taking it for 6-7 months, if you are taking for  1-2-3 years, you may need a year to go off WITH NO SIDE EFFECT....TAMPER THE INCREASE-DECREADE DOSE SLOWLY. (Quitting cold turkey...means pure madness do NOT do that).

I have been on this medication for at least 10 years.","the withdrawal symptoms i experienced were horrendous - involving vomiting, tremendous nausea and compared to the worst kind of flu i ever had.","Symptoms are possibly bad: symptoms mentioned but no verb found",vomiting,effexor

"Effexor XR was a wonderful thing for me.  I took it happily for 15 years.  Then I developed severe acne at age 51.  It took three years to finally find the cause.  Effexor XR.  I went through some rough withdrawal, even with other medications.  I have not found a suitable replacement yet.  It's been a horrible ordeal.  I will get better.  This skin reaction was listed under rare reactions.  I just want people to know, don't ignore the rare reactions and they can happen, even after years of taking a medication with no problems.

"ve previously used Zoloft, Cipralex, Seroxat for depression and anxiety. Effexor was my last attempt at antidepressants. I've been on a relatively low dose of 75 mg. Used it for approximately one year. Like the other meds, Effexor did next to nothing to improve my depression or alleviate anxiety, except causing me to cry less (instead feelings are bottled up inside) and diminishing my libido. The main difference between Effexor and the other brands is much worse withdrawal symptoms. I've been following my doctor's instructions for weaning off the medicine for three weeks, still I experience debilitating dizziness and what feels like small electric shocks to the brain. Constantly. A truly horrible drug. Can't wait to get it out of my system.

"Effectiveness of Effexor XR (150 mg daily) for depression:  sadness and crying over nothing was practically eliminated;  enjoyed being with people again;  stopped worrying that something bad was going to happen;  easier to deal with life's difficulties.  Overall I think it was easier for others to be around me and a good drug of choice for the time.

Undesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.  Realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.  Extreme yawning and felt groggy always.  Dry mouth (which I think is a side effect of most anti-depressants).  A missed dosage (which seldom happened) would make me feel very light-headed and woozy.  Be sure to follow your Doctor's recommendations for changes in dosage (increase or decrease).

Was off Effexor XR for about 9 months. Sex life improved 500%.  Energy level improved and gave me motivation to exercise and lose about 20 lbs.  Other than that, everything irritates me and I am not easy to be around (type A perfectionist that I am).  Back to my MD today.  Am going to try Lexapro.","realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.","Symptoms are possibly bad: symptoms mentioned but no verb found",nightmares,effexor
"This medication caused rapid heart beat and chest pains so severe I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack.  I had no history of high blood pressure or heart disease.  I was given 5 nitroglycerin tablets under my tongue pand then a patch to get my blood pressure down.  I had to spend 3 days in the hospital (without health insurance) and now I am in debt for $24,000.  I told my dr I was having side effects and he said that he never heard of the symptoms I complained about while taking Effexor..he actually doubled my dose.  That's when I ended up going to the hospital.  Even though I only took it for about 8 or 9 weeks, the withdrawal was horrible..also, the medicine and psychiatrist costs were very expensive,,,terrible experience.","this medication caused rapid heart beat and chest pains so severe i went to the emergency room thinking i was having a heart attack.","Symptoms are possibly bad: symptoms mentioned but no verb found","chest pain",effexor

"I've been on this medication for 5 years and can honestly say it gave me my life back. After getting on the correct dosage, which ended up being 225mg for me, I felt like my old self again. It's not a ""happy pill"" but simply allows me to feel the emotions of everyday life. I laugh like I used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way. Before this medication, I was just crying all the time - for no apparent reason. Other meds have caused me to feel NO emotions at all. Yes, the weight gain of about 15 pounds was frustrating but I could also do more to lose it. I do sweat more as well. I have only missed one dose and there were very minimal side effects which I was expecting - headache, some tingling when I moved my head suddenly.  When I told my doctor these side effects, he asked me if it was worth taking.......ABSOLUTELY. I know it isn't for everyone but for me - I'm just fine with it. I have my life back again.","i laugh like i used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way.","Symptoms are bad: Presence of negative verb + symptoms",pica,effexor

"My personal experience with with drug tells me there are no good reviews on this drug. The 5 star reviews are just INCOMPLETE reviews, that in time will show this nasty drug for what it is. 7 years on 150 mg. Effexor xr, things were okay, at this point my review would have been positive. Sooo I no longer felt I needed or wanted to take this""medicine"" due to the many, many side effects. I had experienced the negatives 4 hours after my regular scheduled dose... headache would become a migraine with sweating and soon I would be vomiting. so I decided to ween off the pills slowly. My doctor takes me from 150 mg. to 75 mg. I think I can handle it, I was wrong. After 5 months of hell I'm trying to figure out what to do next... Be warned this chemical demon they call effexor is not your savior. My experiences I do not share make me feel like I'm in spiritual warfare.","i had experienced the negatives 4 hours after my regular scheduled dose... headache would become a migraine with sweating and soon i would be vomiting.","Symptoms are bad: Presence of negative verb + symptoms",headache,effexor
