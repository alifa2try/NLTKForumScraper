"""I started taking Tamoxifen in September of 2013. The side effects kicked in after about a week. My fingers completely seized up and if I crouched down I couldn't get up again! The joint pain was unbearable so my oncologist decided to take me off it for 6 months. He then introduced it gradually, 10mg a day instead of 20mg. So far so good! After 6 months of that he put me back up to the full dose and the pain didn't return! I've been on it ever since. My periods are here and there but are quite heavy and painful when I do get them. I wish they'd just stop. Just keeping everything crossed that the cancer stays away. Good luck to all you fellow survivors and keep fighting the fight!

"""I had Stage 1 IDC Breast Cancer, diagnosed in June 2013, mastectomies in August 2013, started tamoxifen October 2013.  After experiencing stomach digestive issues I went off it in March 2014 until August, then back on and have been on it ever since.  So almost 1 year straight, but another 5 months of it before that as well.  My biggest complaint is feeling so wiped out by the end of the day.  I take it at night when going to bed, usually 10pm-ish.  Does anyone think switching the time I take the pill will matter?  I have also noticed a 5-10 pound weight gain.

I have been taking Tamoxifen for over three years now. I have had excessive hot flashes and mood swings.

Recently, Sept. 2014, I had a D & C to stop excessive bleeding, remove polyps and reduce the thickness of uterus walls. The polyps were noncancerous - Thank GOD. Now as a postmenopausal woman, I have to have my uterus removed, Jan. 2015, because of the contiuous bleeding and polyps quickly reforming.

I have an appointment with my oncologist today to discuss medication options. I will see my primary care physician in a couple of weeks for health updates, just before seeing my ob/gyn surgeon in Jan. 2015. Ladies, make sure we do our part in getting the most effective health care by going to doctors and maintaining a personal health log. As a team, we can give breast cancer, a run for its money.

"Age 42 Breast cancer multi focal, Stage IIA two lympnodes positive, Mastectomy Nov 2010, AC+Taxol Jan 2011-June2011. I chose to wait 3 months before starting Tamoxifen on Oct 24, 2011. So far so good. I cannot identify the side effects directly related to tamoxifen because small side effects from Chemo still there a little bit. Hot flashes and joint pain from CHemo subsided and do not return with Tamoxifen. No bone pains or headaches. I have some sleeplessness but dealing with it by taking Tamoxifen in the morning, only one coffee in the morning, and dringking Camomile warm tea before bedtime. This is helping so far. Every other couple days, I will take 1-2 capsules of valarian roots to help get a good night sleep. You are not supposed to take this every day. Noticed slight weight gain but control with healthy eating and less portion of carbs at dinner time. No fried food. Big breafast and lunch with increase in vegetables and fresh fruits. I do not exercise! In fact,I notice a light weight loss this morning! I read a lot of reviews about this drug and took some preperation prior to starting Tamoxifen. I am now taking 1 Omega-3 in the morning, 1 multivitamin (1 a day woman) at lunch time and 1 calcium with D3/Mag/Zinc & 1 Omega-3 at Dinner time. I think this keeps me from having bone and joint pain and also keep blood clots which cause leg pains away. For those who have a lot of side effects, you might want to consult your doctor to see if these vitamins will help you. Good luck everyone! I hope my information helps!

Gained 25 lbs. even while going to aerobics 3 times a week, weight lifting and walking 10 miles per week. Had to stop all this exercise due to pain. Been of T 7 days and symptoms are improving.

"LCIS with 1mm invasive found with surgical biopsy. Lumpectomy showed no more invasive in the breast but lots of LCIS. Doctor was shocked to find 4 lymph nodes positive. Chemo followed. Then double mastectomies. Wanted to avoid the DIEP flap reconstruction so expanders were put in the same day. 5 weeks radiation. Have been on Tamoxifen for 3 months. First side effect noticed was my eyelashes were almost gone. Was scared to lose my hair again. Stopped T for 3 weeks but husband begged me to go back on it. Eyelashes are fully back. Main side effects since have been flushing, small headaches of short duration mainly around one eye, trouble sleeping, dizziness when suddenly sitting up or standing, no noticeable weight gain yet.

Have been active and healty all my life. I can relate to the side effects. Starting 1 month after starting to take each of the following popped in at a rate of 2 each week. Depression, Blood pressure high even w/pills to lower, outer vaginal rash/itching all over, joint pain I limp after sitting at my desk at work, or driving, isomni, Sweating during the day just going to the bathroom or moving around, tired/ lack of motivation, gained 10 pounds immediately and then kept gaining and swelling everywhere could tell if I had any salt the day before.

"I have chosen NOT to take Tamoxifen. Too many side effects for me. I was diagnosed with DCIS Breast Cancer. Found during routine mammogram. Had lumpectomy and am starting radiation next week. My doctor explained to me that Tamoxifen is separate from radiation, it does not go hand in hand. Radiation will decrease the chance of the cancer from coming back in the one breast. Tamoxifen decreases the chance 50% from cancer appearing any where. so the way i look at it is it is a 50/50 chance either way. Not enough for me to take Tamoxifen. This to me is a very scary drug. Everyone of course needs to make their own decisions. But before taking it i would research and not take it unless you feel comfortable with your decision.

What is the chance that I will develop another cancer due to taking the tamoxifen which is a known carcinogen.  How wise it to give women who have had breast cancer a drug that is a carcinogen?

I wish I could have some peace of mind!  I am also concerned about what the lack of estrogen is doing to my aging process.  I feel that I have aged considerably since taking this medication.

In spite of all this it only increases your chance of cancer not coming back by 2%.  The damage that this drug has caused is worse than the 1 stage of DCIS cancer I had.  Drug companies have got to make money even if it is at the cost of patients lives.  I am looking into more natural things I can do with eating better, exercising and taking vitamins if I need them.  My dr. even said that 2% means cancer may not come back in that breast but can come back somerwhere else even if you are on the med.  I choose quality over quanity.

"Just finishing 5 miserable years on this drug, for stage 1 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, a tiny tumor.  Seems like overkill, trying to smash a fly with a sledgehammer.  I doubt I even needed to be on this horrible drug, which caused the following side effects: very stiff and painful joints - especially in the hands and feet, hot flashes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, heart irregularities (had to be put on heart med to control), tired most days, minimal hair loss.  I feel 20 years older than I am, like a shriveled up old lady. Limping around.  I get off this drug in a month and will be celebrating my 60th birthday - hoping to feel younger instead of older.   If doctors had to experience these side effects, they might prescribe this medication less often.  I don't think it was worth going through 5 years of awful quality of life to lower my chance of a recurrence by just a few percentage points.  It hardly seems worth it, and I regret doing it.

"firstly I cannot say anything yet about the effectiveness of the drug as I have only been on it for a short time, so I put what I hope it will be. I was diagnosed in October 2014 with breast cancer had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal. The cancer had not spread to the nodes, thank god. I had radiotherapy for a month and will be having my final session in two days.I started the drug about 3 months ago. I have had no side effects like the ones that most of you have had. I do have slight pain in the hip area and lower left side. I attended my doctor who said it was a kidney infection, but the pain is still there. I don't know if it has anything got to do with the Arimidex. Apart from that I have no problems as yet with it. I'm so sorry to hear from all of you the pain that you are in, its terrible to go on suffering after all you have gone through with the cancer itself. We will all survive this, you have to have hope ladies, and hopefully another drug can be found that will bring us all back to the health we had before the cancer. Keep your chin up ladies and love life.","i have had no side effects like the ones that most of you have had.","No Side Effects",armimidex
"I had a double mastectomy with 4 positive lymph nodes and was Her2 positive. Spent a year taking Herceptin. I was started on arimidex 2 months before I finished my chemotherapy so did not realize for a while that the fatigue, continued hair loss, nausea, sleep problems and joint pain were because of the arimidex. My diabetes, which had been under control before the arimidex, became unmanageable. My oncologist refused to accept that the arimidex was causing any side effects. A few weeks ago I experienced shortness of breath and chest pains. My oncologist immediately took me off the arimidex while continuing to insist that I was not having side effects from the drug, but that I had heart disease. After a complete battery of tests my cardiologist told my oncologist that there was nothing wrong with my heart. My oncologist prescribed aromisin, which has the same and worse side effects. I have been off of arimidex for 3 weeks and finally feel like I am recovering from my chemotherapy, which actually ended in February (it is now October). I have decided to stop the drugs. I have had a negative PET scan and my blood work continues to show that I am cancer free. At age 65 I would like to live my life, and not merely exist. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it then. I am very happy with my decision but would not recommend it for everyone. You need to decide which is more important to you - doing what your doctor says will help or having a better quality of life. Also, there is no guarantee that the cancer will not recur just because one takes the drug.","my oncologist refused to accept that the arimidex was causing any side effects.","Side effects Present - because of no direct inverter word before ",armimidex

"I had a low grade carcinoma and lumpectomy with two lymph nodes removed both of which were clear as well as the surrounding tissue of the small tumor.  I have been taking the generic form of Arimidex, Anastrozole, for 20 days and have decided to discontinue the use.  I never experience side effects to medications I have taken in the past so I deliberately did not read the insert of side effects so that I wouldn't put the thought into my head that I would experience them.  In this short period of time I have suffered Waves of Nausea, Exhaustion, overall Body Pain that just cannot be alleviated with pain meds, Sleeplessness and Hot Flashes that could smelt iron ore.  I just looked at the side effects two days ago just to make sure I wasn't imagining that I could feel this miserable. The doctor wants me to take Effexor for the hot flashes but I vetoed that idea since I've not read anything positive about attempting to get off of that drug.

Unlike some other reviews I've read, I don't have the luxury of staying home and dealing with the side effects.

"Stage 1 Cancer. Lumpectomy Feb 2012 and 7 weeks of radiation. Started Arimidex 2 weeks after surgery.  Exhaustion was blamed on the radiation.  After 18 months, I have stopped the Arimidex.  Oncologist put me on Femera, but the aches and pain were worse. Now I have 6 trigger fingers, constant shoulder and elbow pain. The swelling in my hands and knees have been unbearable.  My blood work indicates that my cholesterol is increasing. Now I am watching my blood pressure increase.  So, no more pills. No more Effexor of hot flashes either.  I do take a Biotin supplement for hair thinning - hair has thickened.  I have chosen quality over quantity for my life.  I have always been extremely active, but this past 1 1/2 yrs has been miserable.  I hope other folks have better luck, but after reading reviews, I am so very grateful to know I am not crazy.

"I have taken the drug arimidex (now the generic version anastrazole) and have experienced many adverse side effects. The most problematic is lack of sleep and some weight gain (particularly in my gut area). This is despite exercising more than I have ever done. There is also stiffness, some pain and the general feeling of being unwell. Sometimes it is hard to get around as my joints seem unpredictable and my muscles taunt. I now have very high cholesterol and high blood pressure (both new issues) and recurrent depression and anxiety disorder. Overall, I prefer to remain at home where there are no expectations of me and I do not have the stress of preparing to go out or coping in social settings. This includes seeing my immediate family which makes me feel even more guilty. I have taken the drugs for a year and a half and do not have a foreseeable end to this.

No side effects, i felt great BUT my gyn doctor found lots uterin fybroids (sp) and after surgery was told i had to be put on the last resort, arimedex.

The joint pain started slowly in an elbow joint and now is in just about every joint in my body.  My fingers are stiff in the morning and swollen (I have taken my rings off).  I have gained weight, but feel that has been a direct result of my feeling tired alot and not exercising like I should.

Pain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away eventually,) not sleeping, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, weight loss, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an ""unlikely but very serious side affect"" and to call doctor immediately.
Oncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did, and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. Hmmm. She didn't put me on anything else.
Anyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone, although the appetite is taking a while to come back, but I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months.

Warning... The withdrawal symptoms are AWFUL and SCAREY! I was released as a patient by my family doctor after he had complications with my mother and she passed. Due to the doctor change my scripts needed an authorized refill. Well, getting a new doctor takes longer then 30 days, so I had no choice but to stop my meds. I WAS SENT TO THE ER BY DAY 3 OF WITHDRAWALS. IT WAS SO INTENSE I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE HOSPITAL.

"Dear all, I am sorry to hear/read such as bad negative statements. 

Yes the withdrawn symptoms, yes very difficult to get off the drug BUT you MUST tamper very very slowly. 
I learnt this and I am on and off this drug say once a year and/or when I want, here what I do...

From a health shop I buy some hawthorn herbs capsule (*I need the capsule to be empty*, so I put the hawthorn powder on my cereals –it is good for you, but sue that is not the topic)

Then if I started with 37.5, I open the capsule and divide the content in two>
Take for 5 days
Then>take 2 capsules 37.5 and divide the content in 3 capsule >take for 5/7days

Then you are at 37.5 (one original capsule) > take for at least 10 day (if you need to increase the dosage ...same fashion described, .. 
one 75 capsule, split in two and so on. 

AND TAKE NOTE WRITE ALL DOWN, TIME AND DOSAGE. If you use Effexor XR this way + cognitive therapy = The nightmare is over...live is fabulous again-;) (Well this is my experience anyway)

If you do not do this, yes all that bad stuff happens.
***Felling over optimist and a bit ...to happy. Write down a few notes and read them every morning, i.e. I am so confident because of the drug, don’t go overboard.

This is a great fabulous drug for anxiety/rage and depression.

PS: I have being in other antidepressants >same story.... get a pill cutter in the pharmacy.

Bottom line tampering may take you 3-4 months if you are taking it for 6-7 months, if you are taking for  1-2-3 years, you may need a year to go off WITH NO SIDE EFFECT....TAMPER THE INCREASE-DECREADE DOSE SLOWLY. (Quitting cold turkey...means pure madness do NOT do that).

PS. Tranquilizers ...CAREFUL the addiction is greater than the antidepressant

"I started this medication under a year ago. When I first started taking it, I became more suicidal and had a really serious suicide attempt. I was on this for about 4 months with no results. The medication only started to actually work when I added another medication. I went off of it for a while, and experienced really bad withdrawal symptoms. I recently started taking it again, and I am experiencing horrible side effects, including worsening depression and suicidal thoughts.","i went off of it for a while, and experienced really bad withdrawal symptoms.","Side effects Present - because of no direct inverter word before ",effexor

There were times when I felt I no longer needed it and when I stopped taking it (weaning myself down to smaller and smaller does) and went through some harsh withdrawal symptoms.

However, I was negligent in take the meds for 2 days in a row (I was completely involved with something and just FORGOT)  I will never do that again.

"When my son was killed 25 years ago I couldn't come out of my depression, which was manageable before.  I tried several medications and had the best results with Effexor.  Twice I have gradually weaned myself off, but eventually my depression became unmanageable; I am convinced my depression is biochemical and will continue to take Effexor as long as I need to.  I've taken 225mg during the day for 25 years, experience no side effects I can't overcome, and am very happy with the results.  I just need help in meeting my copayments.","i\'ve taken 225mg during the day for 25 years, experience no side effects i can\'t overcome, and am very happy with the results.","No Side Effects",effexor
"ve previously used Zoloft, Cipralex, Seroxat for depression and anxiety. Effexor was my last attempt at antidepressants. I've been on a relatively low dose of 75 mg. Used it for approximately one year. Like the other meds, Effexor did next to nothing to improve my depression or alleviate anxiety, except causing me to cry less (instead feelings are bottled up inside) and diminishing my libido. The main difference between Effexor and the other brands is much worse withdrawal symptoms. I've been following my doctor's instructions for weaning off the medicine for three weeks, still I experience debilitating dizziness and what feels like small electric shocks to the brain. Constantly. A truly horrible drug. Can't wait to get it out of my system.

"Effectiveness of Effexor XR (150 mg daily) for depression:  sadness and crying over nothing was practically eliminated;  enjoyed being with people again;  stopped worrying that something bad was going to happen;  easier to deal with life's difficulties.  Overall I think it was easier for others to be around me and a good drug of choice for the time.

Undesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.  Realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.  Extreme yawning and felt groggy always.  Dry mouth (which I think is a side effect of most anti-depressants).  A missed dosage (which seldom happened) would make me feel very light-headed and woozy.  Be sure to follow your Doctor's recommendations for changes in dosage (increase or decrease).

Was off Effexor XR for about 9 months. Sex life improved 500%.  Energy level improved and gave me motivation to exercise and lose about 20 lbs.  Other than that, everything irritates me and I am not easy to be around (type A perfectionist that I am).  Back to my MD today.  Am going to try Lexapro.","undesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.","Side effects Present - because of no direct inverter word before ",effexor
"This medication caused rapid heart beat and chest pains so severe I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack.  I had no history of high blood pressure or heart disease.  I was given 5 nitroglycerin tablets under my tongue pand then a patch to get my blood pressure down.  I had to spend 3 days in the hospital (without health insurance) and now I am in debt for $24,000.  I told my dr I was having side effects and he said that he never heard of the symptoms I complained about while taking Effexor..he actually doubled my dose.  That's when I ended up going to the hospital.  Even though I only took it for about 8 or 9 weeks, the withdrawal was horrible..also, the medicine and psychiatrist costs were very expensive,,,terrible experience.","i told my dr i was having side effects and he said that he never heard of the symptoms i complained about while taking effexor..he actually doubled my dose.","Side effects Present - because of no direct inverter word before ",effexor

"I've been on this medication for 5 years and can honestly say it gave me my life back. After getting on the correct dosage, which ended up being 225mg for me, I felt like my old self again. It's not a ""happy pill"" but simply allows me to feel the emotions of everyday life. I laugh like I used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way. Before this medication, I was just crying all the time - for no apparent reason. Other meds have caused me to feel NO emotions at all. Yes, the weight gain of about 15 pounds was frustrating but I could also do more to lose it. I do sweat more as well. I have only missed one dose and there were very minimal side effects which I was expecting - headache, some tingling when I moved my head suddenly.  When I told my doctor these side effects, he asked me if it was worth taking.......ABSOLUTELY. I know it isn't for everyone but for me - I'm just fine with it.
