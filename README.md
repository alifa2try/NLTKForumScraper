# NLTKForumScraper

<h3>Getting started</h3>

Make sure that you have the following Python packages installed and that your running Python3.3 or 3.4

```
pip3.4 install requests
pip3.4 install nltk
pip3.4 install beautifulsoup4
pip3.4 install pymysql
```

Given that we will be making use of a number of NLTK Tools, its easier to just download the whole package. Just open up a terminal screen and start python. Proceed to download the nltk packages as such:

```
python3.4
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
```
